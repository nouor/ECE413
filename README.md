## Project Description
Our project explain how to controlling stepper motor rotation by using 3switches: Half Step Switch,Full Step Switch and Stop Switch
we will add another Switch called Get Tempreture ,used to get command from Keypad that connected with Microcintroller (AT89C51RD2).
Stepper motor rotaining by using :-

**1.Half Step Switch:-**

When the half step switch is pressed, the stepper motor will rotate by angles which are multiplies of 45(45,90,135,...360).
it repeates several times until stop switch is pressed.

**2-Full Step Switch:-**

When the full step switch is pressed, the stepper motor will rotate by angles which are multiplies of 90(90,180,270,...360).
it repeates several times until stop switch is pressed.

**3-Stop Switch:-**

It is used to stop stepper motor rotation but if it pressed when the motor rotates in the middle of full rotation or half rotation the motor is rotates first to 360Â° and then stop.

**4-Get From Keypad Switch:-**

When Get From Keypad Switch is pressed the angle is taken from the keypad. After writing the number in the keypad the (*)button must be pressed which represents the enter button and then the motor will rotate one time with this angle.

## How to Work?
1- We choose Microcontroller AT89C51RD2 Features in 8051 Instruction Compatible and get datasheet as shown in Reference.

2- Studying Playlist with 8051 found in Reference .

3- Each one in team Creat Account in Github.

4- open Datasheet and Get How to Interface Switches in Microcontroller .

5- How to coding Timer and Interface Keypad in Microcontroller.

6- Simulation components by using Proteus.

7- Upload code in Proteus and Check it.
