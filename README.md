## Project Description
Our project explain how to controlling stepper motor rotation by using 3switches: Half Step Switch,Full Step Switch and Stop Switch
we will add another Switch called Get Tempreture ,used to get command from Keypad that connected with Microcintroller (AT89C51RD2).
Stepper motor rotaining by using :-

**1.Half Step Switch:-**

When the half step switch is pressed, the stepper motor will rotate by angles which are multiplies of 45(45,90,135,...360).
it repeates several times until stop switch is pressed.

**2-Full Step Switch:-**

When the full step switch is pressed, the stepper motor will rotate by angles which are multiplies of 90(90,180,270,...360).
it repeates several times until stop switch is pressed.

**3-Stop Switch:-**

It is used to stop stepper motor rotation but if it pressed when the motor rotates in the middle of full rotation or half rotation the motor is rotates first to 360° and then stop.(we use interrupt to change a flag which we use condition to check if it is set or not.)

**4-Get From Keypad Switch:-**

When Get From Keypad Switch is pressed the angle is taken from the keypad. After writing the number in the keypad the (*)button must be pressed which represents the enter button and then the motor will rotate one time with this angle.

## How to Work?
1- We choose Microcontroller AT89C51RD2 Features in 8051 Instruction Compatible and get datasheet as shown in Reference.

2- Studying Playlist with 8051 found in Reference .

3- Each one in team Creat Account in Github.

4- open Datasheet and Get How to Interface Switches in Microcontroller .

5- How to coding Timer and Interface Keypad in Microcontroller.

6- Simulation components by using Proteus.

7- Upload code in Proteus and Check it.

## Proteus Simulation:

Using Keil uVision5 to code assembly and simulation as shown in figure, 
Firstly we're connecting microcontroller AT89C51RD2 to keypad by port (P1.0 : P1.6) using this part to input and output,
connected part (P0.0 : P0.2) to switches " full step, half step, get to temperature" which connected to resistance to limit current,
in another side stepper motor connected to driver L293D, Finally we upload code to this simulation and get the result.

## System Design:

## Implementation:

### main:

![WhatsApp Image 2021-01-09 at 21 47 47](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76590052/104107385-5ea6f600-52c4-11eb-989d-3697593acaef.jpeg)

So the main function should execute in the program memory address 0000H. 
The main function will check which switch of ( Half Step Switch - Full Step Switch - Get From Keypad Switch) is pressed and then will execute the instructions that belongs to his branch.
we initialize R7=0 as a flag to check if stop switch is pressed or not.
also, we configure the interrupt which we will use for stop switch in main function.

### interrupt:

![IMG-20210109-WA0128](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76590052/104107114-b8a6bc00-52c2-11eb-972c-b099e969e624.jpg)

We use (INT0) for stop switch so we should locate the interrupt in the program memory address 0003H.

![IMG-20210109-WA0131](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76590052/104107172-0a4f4680-52c3-11eb-90c7-4b59b2ebe21f.jpg)
![IMG-20210109-WA0132](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76590052/104107195-29e66f00-52c3-11eb-8a40-88f3d55319bc.jpg)

Interrupt generated by a falling edge signal at INT0. (switch is connected as negative logic).

![IMG-20210109-WA0130](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76590052/104107145-ec81e180-52c2-11eb-9d36-98342986936d.jpg) 

Enables the external interrupt0 INT0.
Enables the global interrupt control.

The function of interrupt when it's happened is to change R7 (flag) to one.

### INTERFACING_KEYPAD:
every 0.5 second only one of the column pins will be output and the rest will be input pins include the row pins.
when a button pressed in keypad, we get the key value by formula:
key value = ((row*N_col) + col + 1)


### Delay:
we use timer to implement delay function.

### Timer:
![IMG-20210109-WA0133](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76590052/104107244-7cc02680-52c3-11eb-937a-0f14c5b0f734.jpg)

![IMG-20210109-WA0135](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76590052/104107284-aed18880-52c3-11eb-93d4-2eccdd3805e0.jpg) 

![IMG-20210109-WA0134](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76590052/104107266-93667d80-52c3-11eb-906d-1106c4e10a3c.jpg)

Assume the processor is clocked by a 12MHz crystal.
That means, the timer clock input will be 12MHz/12 = 1MHz
That means, the time taken for the timer to make one increment = 1/1MHz = 1uS
2^16 = 65536 is the maximim number of counts possible for a 16 bit timer.
Let TH be the value value that has to be loaded to TH registed and TL be the value that has to be loaded to TL register.
Then, THTL =  Hexadecimal equivalent of (65536-X) where (65536-X) is considered in decimal.

Let the required delay be 50000uS (ie; 50mS).
That means X = 50000
65536 – X =  65536 – 50000 = 15536.
64536 is considered in decimal and converting it t0 hexadecimal gives 3CB0
That means THTL = 3C
Therefore TH=FC and TL=B0
Program for generating 50mS delay using 8051 timer.
